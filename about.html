          <p>I always follow the fashion philosophy of color harmony and not blindly follow the trend. I keep my clothes on without having to check three colors. And I won't change my dress habits just because of the current fashion trend. I think it's important to keep your own identity.</p>

          <h3>My philosophy of life</h3>
          <p>I am a Buddhist. I read more and more of the sutras every day. I think Buddhism is like the revelation of the cosmic code, which tells me how to live in the world. The sutras taught me to put down my attachment, reflect on myself and love life. I hold myself to that standard every single day.</p>
